The easiest way to get started with Quasar is to follow these links:

1. [Building Quasar](/docs/buildingquasar)
2. [SQLÂ² Reference](/docs/sqlreference/)

Once Quasar is running you may wish to [secure it](/docs/securingquasar)
or [contribute](http://quasar-analytics.org/#joinus) to the source code.
