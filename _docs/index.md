Quasar is the first native NoSQL analytics engine.

To get started, you simply need an existing data source (currently MongoDB is supported) and
access to the command line on a Windows, Mac or Linux system.

The fastest way to get started with Quasar is to follow the SQL<sup>2</sup> tutorial link:

* [SQLÂ² Tutorial](/docs/sqltutorial/)

Once you have finished and understand how to use both SQL<sup>2</sup> and
the Quasar REPL console, you can start to build applications that utilize the
Web API as well.

Ready to use Quasar in production?  You can secure Quasar and
even contribute your own changes to the source code using these links:
